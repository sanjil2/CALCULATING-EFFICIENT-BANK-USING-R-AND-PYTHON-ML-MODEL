# CALCULATING-EFFICIENT-BANK-USING-R-AND-PYTHON-ML-MODEL

Banks' technical efficiency is defined as the difference between observed. quantity of input and output variables with respect to optimal quantity of input and output variables. An efficient bank can achieve a maximum value of one in comparison to an inefficient bank, which can reduce to the level of zero.
